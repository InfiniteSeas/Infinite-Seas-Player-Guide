Since our game is still in the early stages, there may be some bugs that need to be resolved.

If you find a bug, please do us a favor and post it in our Discord channel, [#Identify-bugs](https://discord.gg/eRz6xeUGVM).&#x20;

Once you submit a bug, we will work hard to resolve it ASAP, but please be patient >\_<
