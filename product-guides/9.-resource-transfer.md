  * To transfer resources between your ship and an island, your ship must be close to the island.
  * Access the transfer function by selecting the `Ships`, then press the <mark style="color:yellow;">**`Transfer Inventory`**</mark> button. Choose the resources to move and confirm the transfer.
* <mark style="color:red;">**Ship Transfer:**</mark>
  * You can also transfer resources between ships within the same roster. To do this, select the `Ships`, navigate to the roster, and hit the <mark style="color:yellow;">**`Transfer Inventory`**</mark> button.
  * This allows you to distribute resources strategically among your ships, ensuring each one is prepared for upcoming battles.
