### Sailing Your Ship

To set sail, you need to add your ships to a roster - for example - "<mark style="color:yellow;">**roster 1**</mark>".

### Adjust Ship Roster

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**To Add**</mark>**:** To add a ship to a roster, first navigate to that roster - "roster 1". Then, click on the "+" at the bottom to select a ship from the unassigned group.
* **To Delete:** To delete a ship from the roster, click the "x" in the top right corner of that ship.
* **To Reorder:** To reorder ships in a roster, drag the ship to your desired position. In combat, the ships at the top of the roster will be attacked first.
