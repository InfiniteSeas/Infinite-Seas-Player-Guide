# 🏝️ 3. Claim an Island

After all game assets are loaded, the first thing you need to do is claim an island.&#x20;

We have generated 120 islands on the map, each with a random position.&#x20;

### Resource Distribution

The resource distribution on each island varies—wood, seeds, ore—and each resource has different utilities.&#x20;

### Island Coordinates

The physical location of an island matters; being close to other islands means more risk from opponents, but it also allows you to form alliances (currently, you can form alliances with members in Discord; later, this feature will be built into the game).
