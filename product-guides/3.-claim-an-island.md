### Resource Distribution

The resource distribution on each island varies‚Äî<mark style="color:green;">**wood, seeds, ore**</mark>‚Äîand each resource has different utilities.&#x20;

### Island Coordinates ‚ú®

The physical location of an island <mark style="color:purple;">**MATTERS**</mark>; being close to other islands means more risk from opponents, but it also allows you to form alliances (currently, you can form alliances with members in Discord; later, this feature will be built into the game).
