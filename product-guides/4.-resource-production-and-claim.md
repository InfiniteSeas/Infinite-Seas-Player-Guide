### Island Inventory

Once you enter the `island inventory` , you can see all the resources you have harvested. To harvest resources into your inventory, you need to use the next three buttons on the right.

### Mining 🧺

When you click on <mark style="color:purple;">**`Mining`**</mark> , you will select `ore`, which is the only unlocked resource currently available. Mining costs $Energy and takes a certain amount of time.

* **Recommend**: mine **5** ore each time
* One `ore` equals one point added to `Attack` when crafting ships.

### Woodcutting 🪵

When you click on <mark style="color:yellow;">**`Woodcutting`**</mark> , you will select  `normal wood` , which is currently the only unlocked resource. Woodcutting costs $Energy and takes a certain amount of time.

* **Recommend**: woodcut 5 normal wood each time
* One piece of `normal wood` equals one point added to `Defense` when crafting ships.

### Planting 🌾

When you click on <mark style="color:green;">**`Planting`**</mark>, you will select `cotton`, which is currently the only unlocked resource. Planting costs $Energy and takes a certain amount of time.

* **Recommend**: plant 1 cotton seed each time, it gives you 5 cottons from 1 seed
* One piece of `cotton` equals one point added to `Speed` when crafting ships.

### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Resource Claim - Action Queue 🫴</mark>

* After you produced the resources, the next step for you is to <mark style="color:blue;">**claim the resources**</mark>!
* If you click on the `Island` button again in the bottom right corner, you will see a list of ongoing actions. When these actions are completed, you can click <mark style="color:yellow;">**`Get`**</mark> to harvest the resources. Once harvested, they will appear in your `Inventory`.
